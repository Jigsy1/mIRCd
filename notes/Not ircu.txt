The following commands are generally not part of ircu based IRCds, but I have included them because of their usefulness.

* KNOCK
* SHUN
* ZLINE

Also added the following due to the fact that /msg or /notice $* doesn't work because I haven't coded it in.

* GNOTICE

It's called GNOTICE because mIRC cannot read files called GLOBAL, so GLOBAL.HELP doesn't work.
