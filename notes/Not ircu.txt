The following commands are generally not part of ircu based IRCds, but I have included them because of their usefulness.

* ACCEPT	(Only for use in +m.)
* KNOCK
* SHUN		(Well, this one sort of is.)
* ZLINE

Also added the following - now deprecated - due to the fact that /msg or /notice $* didn't work because I hadn't
coded it in.

* GNOTICE

It's called GNOTICE because mIRC cannot read files called GLOBAL, so GLOBAL.HELP doesn't work.
