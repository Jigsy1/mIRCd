The following commands are missing from the IRCd.

Misc:
-----
CNOTICE		(Reason: Although mIRCd now has "excess flood protection" - sort of, this is supposed to override
CPRIVMSG		 that. However, mIRCd uses a different method, so I cannot add these two afaik.)
PROTO		(Reason: I've never been able to figure out what this command is actually supposed to do.)

Server linking:
---------------
ACCOUNT
BURST
DESTRUCT
DESYNCH
CONNECT
CREATE		(Note: This is actually sent via P10 when a user makes a channel.)
END_OF_BURST
EOB_ACK
JUPE
RPING
RPONG
SERVER		(Note: I could technically add this in and make it work a little like POST.)
SQUIT
TRACE

Ones I can add, but haven't (as of yet):
----------------------------------------
SETTIME		(Note: Testing this on bircd, I could set the clock back to 1995.
		       Though there has to be a cut off point, surely?)
