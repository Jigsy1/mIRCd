The following commands are missing from the IRCd.

Misc:
-----
CNOTICE		(Reason: mIRCd has no "Excess Flood" coded in until I decide to code it.)
CPRIVMSG	(Reason: Ditto.)
PROTO		(Reason: I've never been able to figure out what this command is actually supposed to do.)

Server linking:
---------------
ACCOUNT
BURST
DESTRUCT
DESYNCH
CONNECT
CREATE		(Note: This is actually sent via P10 when a user makes a channel.)
END_OF_BURST
EOB_ACK
JUPE
RPING
RPONG
SERVER
SQUIT
TRACE

Ones I can add, but haven't (as of yet):
----------------------------------------
SETTIME		(Note: Testing this on bircd, I could set the clock back to 1995.
		       Though there has to be a cut off point, surely?)
