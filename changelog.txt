mIRCd[0.09hf6(Rev.2)][2021-2023] - 28/01/2023
--------------------------------------------------
1.  /WHO should now work correctly. Though I'm still unsure if it functions correctly like it should on other ircu IRCds.
2.  Corrected two-year-old bugs in GLINE and SHUN.
3.  Added !RrealName support to K-line, GLINE and SHUN.
    However, due to $ being a somewhat special case when it comes to mIRC, I've had to use !R instead of $R.
4.  Fixed a bug where /STATS s would not display the shun item, and /SHUN (no args) would not list any shuns because
    I specified the wrong hash table.
5.  Can now specify a DEFAULT_OPER_SNOMASK by adding DEFAULT_OPER_SNOMASK=<number> under the [Mechanics] in the mIRCd.ini.
    Defaults to 17157.
6.  Fixed a possible bug where SNOMASK was being overridden by doing /OPER if +s wasn't in the modes being added because
    it had been set prior. (The user will now need to manually change their SNOMASK, basically.)
7.  SNOMASK changes are now noted, when opering up for the first time or doing -s.
8.  Can now specify the default modes for channels when they're created by adding DEFAULT_CHANMODES=<modes> to [Mechanics]
    in mIRCd.ini. This only applies to modes without args, and defaults to +nt if not specified.
9.  Can now specify the default modes for users when they connect to the IRCd by adding DEFAULT_USERMODES=<modes> to
    [Mechanics] in the mIRCd.ini. (With some exceptions, like +o or +X.)
10. /CLEARMODE now removes +c.
11. Updated mIRCd_modeParse.mrc to tell the user if a channel mode doesn't exist. (Already existed for user modes.)
    This should allow users to remove modes they don't want parsing from $mIRCd.chanModes and $mIRCd.userModes.
12. Can now specify if you want Halfop (%) support enabled by adding HALFOP=TRUE or HALFOP=FALSE to [Features] in the mIRCd.ini.
    Defaults to FALSE.
13. Can now specify if you want Persistant Channel support (+P) by adding PERSISTANT_CHANNELS=TRUE or PERSISTANT_CHANNELS=FALSE
    to [Features] in mIRCd.ini. Defaults to FALSE.
14. Can now specify if you want Oper Override support enabled (+X) by adding OPER_OVERRIDE=TRUE or OPER_OVERRIDE=FALSE to
    [Features] in mIRCd.ini. Defaults to FALSE.
15. Added an option to allow loose obfuscation of hosts when a user +x. What this means that whenever people on the same
    ip addresses do +x, each of their hosts will be different rather than the same.
    This can be enabled by adding LOOSE_OBFUSCATION=TRUE to [Features] in the mIRCd.ini.
16. Added channel mode +u to hide part/quit messages from other users.
17. Added chan mode +j <N>. This prevents users who have been connected to the IRCd for less than N second(s) from joining.
18. Added in /PRIVMSG $* and /NOTICE $* support, however, this is not without it's issues due to mIRC and $ being a
    special case.
    On an ircu IRCd, you can /msg $*,$*.tld,$nameOfSer*,nick and it will message all of those.
    However, with this, it only does the first, everything after the $* will be dropped.
    E.g. $*,nick will only message $* and completely skip the nick.

    This isn't an issue when you're not an oper though, it'll still process normally.
19. This means that GNOTICE has been deprecated. However, it has been retained in the codebase as a backup. (Though not callable.)
20. Updated the code that the connection goes through a little faster if ident/dns is finished with.
21. Can now call the information window (@mIRCd) from the Menubar.
22. Updated WHO.help and WHO_FLAGS.help to explain what flags are.
23. Other minor changes. (debugUser.mrc, example K-lines, other help files, etc.)


mIRCd[0.09hf5(Rev.2)][2021-2023] - 27/01/2023
--------------------------------------------------
1.  You can now limit the amount of users on the IRCd by using MAX_USERS=<number> under [Server] in the mIRCd.ini.
    Those connecting via localhost (127.*) and LAN (192.168.*) are not subject to this restriction.
2.  You can now deny external connections to the IRCd by using DENY_EXTERNAL_CONNECTIONS=TRUE under [Mechanics] in the mIRCd.ini.
    Those connecting via localhost (127.*) and LAN (192.168.*) are not subject to this restriction.
3.  Fixed bugs regarding oper override:

    * Opers can now /INVITE, /KICK, change /MODEs and the /TOPIC when not on the channel.
    * Since I apparently forgot to code it in two years ago, opers can now walk past +i, +k, etc.

4.  Oper override now trumps +K and +Y. (Though since they could just past the modes, why would they need to use /KNOCK?)
5.  Fixed a bug in KNOCK where I specified %this.nick instead of %this.knock, meaning the channel name didn't show.
6.  Users should now at least see the server notice when DIE and RESTART are issued.
7.  WHOWAS cache cleaning will start on the next hour from when you started the IRCd.
    E.g. If, for example, you start the IRCd at 21:47, the cleaning timer will start at 22:00.
8.  Added /WHO. (WHOX)

    I'm not going to lie, there are a couple of bugs with it. For example, a channel that's not +s and a user who is +i,
    the user who is +i is on the channel and you do /WHO #chan,user. You will get no results even though you should for the nick.

    But if you do /WHO user,#chan you'll see the user. (You can /WHO on +i users if you know their nick.)

    This is my own fault with the way I've coded it. But rather than chase down even more bugs - I've spent two
    solid days on this already - I've decided to just okay it for now and I'll eventually try and redo it at some point
    in time.

    Other than that, everything else works as it should. /WHO #chan,nick, /WHO * r :*, /WHO * %nr, etc.

9.  You can throttle the use of WHO by adding WHO_THROTTLE=<number> under [Mechanics] in the mIRCd.
10. Other major and minor bug fixes/tweaks.


mIRCd[0.09hf4(Rev.2)][2021-2023] - 15/01/2023:
--------------------------------------------------
1. Updated debugUser.mrc to use /debugUser.raw instead of: sockwrite -nt $sockname
2. I decided to add the mode to block colors (+c) on channels. Bold, underline, etc. will still work.
   Just like the polarity of +p/+s, this cannot be set in conjunction with +S.
3. Ditto, but for usermode.
4. Added a channel mode to hide the modes set on a channel from appearing in /LIST. (+H)
5. Updated CHANMODES.help and USERMODES.help to clarify a few things better.
6. Added /WHOWAS.
7. Other minor changes.


mIRCd[0.09hf3(Rev.2)][2021] - 11/01/2023:
---------------------------------------------
1. /LIST STOP cannot be used if connected on the IRCd for < CONNECTED_LIST_THROTTLE.
2. Minor string correction(s).


mIRCd[0.09hf2(Rev.2)][2021] - 30/07/2022:
---------------------------------------------
1. Fixed a typo in mIRCd.mrc.
2. Corrected the final line in SNOMASK.help.
3. Added root to nicks.403.
4. Corrected (not -i or -k) to (not set as +i or +k) in KNOCK.help.
5. Updated example K-lines.
6. Updated CHANMODES.help and USERMODES.help to clarify a couple of things better.
7. Removed some unused code from mIRCd_connHandle.mrc.
