mIRCd[0.09hf4(Rev.2)][2021-2023]:
-----------------------------------
1. Updated debugUser.mrc to use /debugUser.raw instead of: sockwrite -nt $sockname
2. I decided to add the mode to block colors (+c) on channels. Bold, underline, etc. will still work.
   Just like the polarity of +p/+s, this cannot be set in conjunction with +S.
3. Ditto, but for usermode.
4. Added a channel mode to hide the modes set on a channel from appearing in /LIST. (+H)
5. Updated CHANMODES.help and USERMODES.help to clarify a few things better.
6. Added /WHOWAS.
7. Other minor changes.

mIRCd[0.09hf3(Rev.2)][2021]:
------------------------------
1. /LIST STOP cannot be used if connected on the IRCd for < CONNECTED_LIST_THROTTLE.
2. Minor string correction(s).

------------------------------
1. Fixed a typo in mIRCd.mrc

3. Added root to nicks.403
4. Corrected (not -i or -k) to (not set as +i or +k) in KNOCK.help
5. Updated example K-lines
6. Updated CHANMODES.help and USERMODES.help to clarify a couple of things better
7. Removed some unused code from mIRCd_connHandle.mrc
