mIRCd[0.09hf5(Rev.2)][2021-2023] - 27/01/2023
--------------------------------------------------
1. You can now limit the amount of users on the IRCd by using MAX_USERS=<number> under [Server] in the mIRCd.ini.
   Those connecting via localhost (127.*) and LAN (192.168.*) are not subject to this restriction.
2. You can now deny external connections to the IRCd by using DENY_EXTERNAL_CONNECTIONS=TRUE under [Mechanics] in the mIRCd.ini.
   Those connecting via localhost (127.*) and LAN (192.168.*) are not subject to this restriction.
3. Fixed a bugs regarding oper override:

   * Opers can now /INVITE, /KICK, change /MODEs and the /TOPIC when not on the channel.
   * Since I apparently forgot to code it in two years ago, opers can now walk past +i, +k, etc.

4. Oper override now trumps +K and +Y. (Though since they could just past the modes, why would they need to use /KNOCK?)
5. Fixed a bug in KNOCK where I specified %this.nick instead of %this.knock, meaning the channel name didn't show.
6. Users should now at least see the server notice when DIE and RESTART are issued.
7. WHOWAS cache cleaning will start on the next hour from when you started the IRCd.
   E.g. If, for example, you start the IRCd at 21:47, the cleaning timer will start at 22:00.
8. Added /WHO. (WHOX)

   I'm not going to lie, there are a couple of bugs with it. For example, a channel that's not +s and a user who is +i,
   the user who is +i is on the channel and you do /WHO #chan,user. You will get no results even though you should for the nick.

   But if you do /WHO user,#chan you'll see the user. (You can /WHO on +i users if you know their nick.)

   This is my own fault with the way I've coded it. But rather than chase down even more bugs - I've spent two
   solid days on this already - I've decided to just okay it for now and I'll eventually try and redo it at some point
   in time.

   Other than that, everything else works as it should. /WHO #chan,nick, /WHO * r :*, /WHO * %nr, etc.

9. You can throttle the use of WHO by adding WHO_THROTTLE=<number> under [Mechanics] in the mIRCd.
10. Other major and minor bug fixes/tweaks.


mIRCd[0.09hf4(Rev.2)][2021-2023] - 15/01/2023:
--------------------------------------------------
1. Updated debugUser.mrc to use /debugUser.raw instead of: sockwrite -nt $sockname
2. I decided to add the mode to block colors (+c) on channels. Bold, underline, etc. will still work.
   Just like the polarity of +p/+s, this cannot be set in conjunction with +S.
3. Ditto, but for usermode.
4. Added a channel mode to hide the modes set on a channel from appearing in /LIST. (+H)
5. Updated CHANMODES.help and USERMODES.help to clarify a few things better.
6. Added /WHOWAS.
7. Other minor changes.

2. Minor string correction(s).
