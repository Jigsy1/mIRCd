# mIRCd
An IRCd written in mIRC scripting language (mSL) and more or less based on ircu based IRCds.

Not meant to be used as a proper IRCd since there's far better alternatives for that. (Like *actual* IRCds.)

Mainly doing this for my own personal amusement.

That said, currently a work in progress where the only real progress is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MhZfcad.png">connecting and usermode parsing</a>. (Even though the modes don't do anything yet.)
