# mIRCd
An IRCd written in mIRC scripting language (mSL) and more or less based on ircu based IRCds.

Not meant to be used as a proper IRCd since there's far better alternatives for that. (Like *actual* IRCds.)

Mainly doing this for my own personal amusement.

That said, this repo is currently a placeholder as the script is a work in progress where only <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NkiGm8f.png">connecting and usermode parsing</a> works. (Though the modes don't do anything yet.)

# To do
1. Optimize the current code because I believe it caused the hard drive to overheat. (Yeah...)
