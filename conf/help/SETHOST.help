<thisCommand> <fakehost> <password>

Set a fakehost using an already configured S:line.

The same can be done by doing /MODE <thisNick> +h <fakehost> <password>.

To unset it, simply do /<thisCommand> UNDO or /mode <thisNick> -h.

Examples:
---------------
/<thisCommand> Number.One.Admin thisPassword
/MODE <thisNick> +h Number.One.Admin thisPassword
/MODE <thisNick> -h
/<thisCommand> UNDO
